Database to keep track of who creates what channels
When someone creates new channel, shiny raids will be pingable, and after they ping it will not be pingable again.
If two people make a channel make sure shiny raids is tagged twice before ping option is off
Make a leaderboard to keep track of who hosts the most, keep track of this through how long the channel is open for.
Cool embeds for everything
When channel is created show embed of available commands and steps hosts should take to host i.e. ping shiny raids, state raid, etc.
In case hosts forget to close channel, remind them to close channel through dms if they haven't talked in the channel for a period of time. Hosts can choose in dms whether the channel is still being used or not.
